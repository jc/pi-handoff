- Use release headers as `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.

- Keep entries short and operator/user-facing.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `/handoff-save [--path <path>] <task>` to generate and save portable handoff prompts (default path: `~/.pi/handoff/latest.md`).
- Added `--path` option support to `/handoff-view` and `/handoff-load`.
- Added `/handoff-load --delete-after-load` to send a saved handoff prompt and then delete the file.

### Changed

- Removed `/handoff --write` in favor of explicit `/handoff-save` command to simplify the workflow.
- Updated `/handoff-load` and `/handoff-view` to use `--path` instead of positional path arguments.
- Updated README usage/docs with the save/load/view path-flag workflow.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/handoff-save` in interactive UI so it only writes the handoff file and no longer pre-fills the input editor.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- None.

### Changed

- Increased `/handoff` wait timeout from 30 seconds to 5 minutes before reporting a timeout while generating the handoff note.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- None.

### Changed

- None.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/handoff` race condition where handoff note capture could run before the assistant response was persisted, causing false "Failed to capture handoff note" errors.

### Added

- None.

### Changed

- Updated peer dependency `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` to `^0.53.0`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- None.

### Changed

- `/handoff` now sends the generated handoff note and task to the new session immediately instead of pre-filling the editor for manual submission.

### Fixed

- None.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- Added automated GitHub Actions release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggered by stable `vX.Y.Z` tags.
- Added release validation and notes extraction scripts: `scripts/verify-release-tag.mjs` and `scripts/changelog-release-notes.mjs`.

### Changed

- Updated release process to use trusted publishing (`npm publish --provenance --access public`) from CI instead of manual local publishing.
- Added canonical npm release scripts (`release:verify-tag`, `release:notes`, `release:gate`) to `package.json`.

### Fixed

- None.
